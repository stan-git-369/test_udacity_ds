## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2011 to 2020 to better understand:

1. Can we predict the job satisfaction?
2. What factors are most important to job satisfaction?
3. Tendencies and trends on IT developing market, most popular languages and platforms?

## File Description <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@tat.v.sid/it-market-trends-9df82334bcc2).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
